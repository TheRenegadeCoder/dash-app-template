# Dash App Template

The Dash app template repo is meant to be a convenience repo for folks
to create a dash app with all the necessary files. I built this repo 
off of a dashboard I created for 
[tracking my teaching data](https://github.com/jrg94/educator-dashboard). 
I plan to use the same template for a future health dashboard. Let
me know if there is anything else you'd like to see in this template
like sample plots.
